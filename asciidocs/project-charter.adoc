== Project Title
Kubernetes Provisioning Tool

== Project Client
HTL Leonding

== Project Background
Many popular cloud services (Azure, IBM, Google Cloud) are too expensive for educational purposes. Also, offers like "free for X hours" often include
hidden costs - this just isn't suitable for our use case.
At the moment, the infrastructure would be available in the school, but it's not possible to give everyone admin privileges, so they can set up their
own environment. That's why we need a tool which simplifies this process with a workflow in the background (a teacher can define restrictions).

== Project Result
There will be a website where the students can log in with their LDAP credentials and request a cluster by filling out a template or by submitting
an own specification (yaml file). The own specifications have to be approved by a teacher.
Teachers are able to create templates (these include %variables% to let students configure services and other configuration options).
Kubernetes automatically handles the creation of the cluster.

== Project Goals
The goal is

* to give students the possibility to create a Kubernetes environment without having to give them full administrative/root privileges.
* to give teachers the possibility to create restrictions for Kubernetes environments.

== Milestones

* figure out how to use the kvm switch
* install new operating system on servers
* get current state of project running on the servers
* parameters for kubernetes yaml file work
* user interface to enter parameters works

== Project Start
Mon., 19.10.2020
